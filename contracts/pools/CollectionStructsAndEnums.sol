 * @dev The RoyaltyDue struct is used to track information about royalty payments that are due on NFT swaps.

 * @dev amount: The amount of the royalty payment, in the token's base units.
 * This value is calculated based on the price of the NFT being swapped, and the royaltyNumerator value set in the AMM pool contract.
 * @dev recipient: The address to which the royalty payment should be sent.
 * This value is determined by the NFT being swapped, and it is specified in the ERC2981 metadata for the NFT.
 * @dev When a user swaps an NFT for tokens using the AMM pool contract, a RoyaltyDue struct is created to track the amount
 * and recipient of the royalty payment that is due on the NFT swap. This struct is then used to facilitate the payment of
 * the royalty to the appropriate recipient.
